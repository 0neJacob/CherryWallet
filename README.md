# Cherry Network Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Cherry Wallet
* **Team Name:** One Team
* **Payment Address:**

## Project Overview

With the launch of the Cherry Network, an entirely new ecosystem of users, developers, and community members have begun to prosper at an impressive rate. However, as new decentralized applications emerge and more users enter the ecosystem, a Cherry community focused browser wallet has become increasingly needed. The wallet needs to be truly user-friendly and easily accessible in different mediums.

With this in mind, One Team is proud to introduce a product that can provide this to the community: **Cherry Wallet**

With the help of the team at Cherry Network and its community members, we will develop a browser extension wallet that can enable community members to manage and interact with the Cherry Network ecosystem in a truly user-centric and aesthetically pleasing way.

## Project Details

### Core Components:
* Account Creation and Management
The Cherry Wallet will enable users to create accounts, import existing accounts, and backup accounts effortlessly. These accounts will be the driving factor for interactions between the users and the Cherry Network.
* Asset Transfers
Users can transfer Cherry from wallet to wallet with clear directions on the transfer amount as well as estimate cost.
* Finance Management
The extension allows for users to perform basic finance inquiries such as view account balance histories, transfer records, and even other asset balances that become supported.
* Customizable Settings
Users will be able to customize this extension and have options such as changing preferred languages, choosing light or dark mode, and other preferences brought up by the community.
* Additional Network Support
Users will also be able to manage assets from different networks as more networks become supported. This will allow users to enjoy the simplicity of managing multiple assets all in one product.
Governance & Staking
Users will also be able to participate in Governance as well as Stake their coins easily through the Cherry Wallet.




## Ecosystem Fit

### How does our project fit into the ecosystem?
With this wallet, users will be able to manage their assets in a browser extension, allowing users to be able to interact with applications built on the Cherry ecosystem as well as interact with others by sending and receiving assets.

### What needs does your project meet?
Other than being able to interact with the Cherry Network ecosystem, users will also be able to experience a friendly and optimized user experience/interface. As global adoption for crypto assets becomes more mainstream, the importance of digestible information for the average crypto user is extremely needed. Our team plans to not only design with industry standards in mind, but also with the Cherry community members in mind. Our UX/UI Designer will ensure that the Cherry Network user is always accounted for within the design as well as collect public polls, opinions, and suggestions from within our own Telegram group.

Furthermore, users will experience the ease of managing and interacting with applications simply by using their internet browser. Though we have hopes of creating a web application that creates a more personalized and feature-rich experience for our users, we are still dedicated to creating an extension that can be conveniently accessed by all Cherry Network community members as well as other network users in the future.

## Future Plans
One Team is a group of skilled and technical individuals with the capability to develop small applications as well as large scale products. With Cherry Wallet, the team intends to continue collecting community feedback to improve and provide improvements to Cherry Wallet. New features, user-experience improvements, and even the addition of newly connected applications within the network is all within the scope of achievement for the team.
For future iterations of Cherry Wallet, One Team will look to pursue cross-platform functionality with the addition of a mobile wallet and a central dashboard to manage assets relating to the wallet. With user feedback and collective data from the community, One Team will look to provide further services and applications to contribute to making Cherry Network a thriving and enjoyable ecosystem for any new user.



## Additional Information
Though this proposal is specifically for the production of Cherry Wallet, One Team looks to take this funding and invest it right back into the community. By allowing us to create a strong financial backing for our team, we can contribute further by becoming a frequent contributor with aspects like staking, node development, validator future responsibilities, as well as being an entity that can provide high level development for years to come.
As experienced as the members are at One Team, we look to be awarded the grant based off of the product itself, not based on empty promises. No payments or any other funding will be rewarded until Cherry Wallet milestones are reached; which is a core principle for One Team. With this in mind, we only look to be recognized for our work only to be able to give us the ability to continue developing on the Cherry Network Blockchain.
